# Mas-Media-App
Basically, Yad and I (hopefully) making an app to solely focus on all social media chats, completely removing reels and ending doom scrolling . 
I'm gonna use python tkinter for GUI, then we need APIs to the social media sites, and then we need a backend thingy where we can store data and do backend .. stuff.
